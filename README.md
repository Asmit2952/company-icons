=============================
`company-icons` is a small web application written to share a collection of icons / logos that I have collected for use in a different project. The icons maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio, making them useful for use in applications that need to maintain a consistent style.

You can access the web application at [https://robthefivenine.github.io/company-icons/](https://robthefivenine.github.io/company-icons/)
